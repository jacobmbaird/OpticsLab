# OPTICS LAB

## Welcome to the Optics Lab

The Optics Lab is a place to explore the physical and geometric properties of light.

### Rays

A light ray has three properties: initial position, iniial directional vector, and frequency.

### Media

A light ray interacts with its media via scattering, refraction, absorption, and reflection.

### Curvature

A light ray may be "bent" by curvature in space caused by massive modies.
